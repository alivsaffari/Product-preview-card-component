I learn a lot about responsive images on web. I use basic solution for providing multiple images in html. 

```html
<picture>
  <source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="images/image-product-desktop.jpg">
  <img src="images/image-product-mobile.jpg" alt="Gabrielle Essence Eau De Parfum">
</picture>
```
